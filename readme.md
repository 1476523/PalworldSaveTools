## Steps to Restore Your Map(Fog and icons):

### This only applies if you do NOT want to use the "Restore Map" option.

### 1. Find the Old Server/World ID:
- **Join your old server/world**.
- Open File Explorer and run the search for: 
	```
	%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\
	```
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **old server/world ID** (e.g., `FCC47F5F4DD6AC48D3C0E2B30059973D`). The folder with the most recent modification date is typically the one for your **old server/world**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **copy** the `LocalData.sav` file from it.

### 2. Find the New Server/World ID:
- **Join your new server/world**.
- Open File Explorer and run the search for: 
	```
	%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\
	```
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **new server/world ID**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **paste** the `LocalData.sav` file from the old server/world ID into this folder.
- If the `LocalData.sav` file already exists in the new folder, **confirm the overwrite** when prompted to replace the existing file.

### 3. Restore Your Map
- Now, go into your **new server/world**, and your map should be restored with the old server/world data.

Done! Your map is back in your **new server/world**!

## üîÅ To Move from Host/Co-op to Server or Vice Versa

For **host/co-op**, the save folder is typically located at:

```
%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\YOURID\RANDOMID\
```

For **dedicated servers**, the save folder is typically located at:

```
steamapps\common\Palworld\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\
```

---

### üß™ Transfer Process

1. Copy **`Level.sav` and the `Players` folder** from either your **host/co-op** or **dedicated server** save folder.
2. Paste **`Level.sav` and the `Players` folder** into the other save folder type (host ‚Üî server).
3. Start the game or server.
4. When prompted to create a **new character**, go ahead and do it.
5. Wait ~2 minutes for the auto-save, then close the game/server.
6. Copy the newly updated **`Level.sav` and `Players` folder** from that world.
7. Paste them into a **temporary folder** somewhere on your PC.
8. Open **PST(PalworldSaveTools)** and choose the **Fix Host Save** option.
9. Select the **`Level.sav`** from your temporary folder.
10. Choose:
    - The **old character** (from original save)
    - The **new character** (you just created)
11. Click **Migrate**.
12. After migration is complete, copy the updated **`Level.sav` and `Players` folder** from the temporary folder.
13. Paste them back into your actual save folder (host or server).
14. Start the game/server and enjoy your character with all progress intact!

# Host Swap Process in Palworld (UID Explained)

## Background
- **Host always uses `0001.sav`** ‚Äî same UID for whoever hosts.
- Each client uses a unique **regular UID save** (e.g. `123xxx.sav`, `987xxx.sav`).

## Key Prerequisite
Both players (old host and new host) **must have their regular saves generated**.  
This happens by joining the host‚Äôs world and creating a new character if none exists.

---

## Step-by-Step Host Swap

### 1. Ensure Regular Saves Exist
- Player A (old host) should have a regular save (e.g. `123xxx.sav`).
- Player B (new host) should have a regular save (e.g. `987xxx.sav`).

### 2. Swap Old Host‚Äôs Host Save to Regular Save
- Use PalworldSaveTools to swap:
  - Old host‚Äôs `0001.sav` ‚Üí `123xxx.sav`  
  (This moves old host‚Äôs progress from host slot to their regular player slot.)

### 3. Swap New Host‚Äôs Regular Save to Host Save
- Use PalworldSaveTools to swap:
  - New host‚Äôs `987xxx.sav` ‚Üí `0001.sav`  
  (This moves new host‚Äôs progress into the host slot.)

---

## Result
- Player B is now the host with their own character and pals in `0001.sav`.
- Player A becomes a client with their original progress in `123xxx.sav`.

---

## Summary
- **Swap old host‚Äôs `0001.sav` to their regular UID save.**
- **Swap new host‚Äôs regular UID save to `0001.sav`.**

---

This process lets both players keep their characters and pals intact while swapping host roles.

# Known Bugs / Issues

## 1. Character Transfer Issues

**Summary:** Character transfers are intended for cross-world/server moves. They transfer your character, inventory, and Pals‚Äîbut not your guild or ownership flags. Here's how to handle the known quirks:

- **Hostile Pals After Transfer**  
  Some Pals may behave aggressively due to ownership issues.  
  **Workaround:** Add the Pal to your party, drop it, and then pick it up again to reassign ownership.

- **Guild Not Transferred**  
  Guilds are not included in Character Transfers by design.  
  **Solutions:**  
  - Use `Fix Host Save` when transferring within the same world/save to preserve the guild.  
  - Alternatively, promote another player to guild leader, leave the guild, transfer, then get re-invited.

## 2. Steam to GamePass Converter Not Working

**Issue:** Changes made via the converter aren't applied or retained.  
**Steps to Fix:**  
1. Close the GamePass version of Palworld.  
2. Wait a few minutes.  
3. Run the Steam to GamePass converter.  
4. Wait again.  
5. Launch the game on GamePass and confirm the updated save is working.

## 3. `struct.error` When Parsing the Save

**Cause:** The save file format is outdated and incompatible with current tools.  
**Solution:**  
- Place the outdated save into Solo, Coop, or Dedicated Server mode.  
- Load the game once to trigger an automatic structure update.  
- Make sure the save was last updated on or after the latest game patch.
