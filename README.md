Follow these steps to delete inactive players based on your criteria (e.g., inactivity, level, or number of pals):

1. Copy Players folder and Level.sav from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) to the (`PalWorldSave`) folder. 
2. Select Scan Save.
3. Select Delete Inactive Players Saves.
4. Input your desired requirements, then let it finish.  
5. Copy the `Players` folder from the `PalWorldSave` folder.  
6. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).  
7. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.  
8. Restart the server:  
   - Reboot once to clear the player from `Level.sav`.  
   - Reboot a second time to clear the player from RAM.  
9. Profit?

## Steps to Restore Your Map(Fog and icons):

### This only applies if you do NOT want to use the "Restore Map" option.

### 1. Find the Old Server/World ID:
- **Join your old server/world**.
- Open File Explorer and run the search for:  
  `%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\`
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **old server/world ID** (e.g., `FCC47F5F4DD6AC48D3C0E2B30059973D`). The folder with the most recent modification date is typically the one for your **old server/world**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **copy** the `LocalData.sav` file from it.

### 2. Find the New Server/World ID:
- **Join your new server/world**.
- Go back to the same folder path:  
  `%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\`
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **new server/world ID**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **paste** the `LocalData.sav` file from the old server/world ID into this folder.
- If the `LocalData.sav` file already exists in the new folder, **confirm the overwrite** when prompted to replace the existing file.

### 3. Restore Your Map
- Now, go into your **new server/world**, and your map should be restored with the old server/world data.

Done! Your map is back in your **new server/world**!

## Where to find the save files:

The save files are usually located at `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\YOURSTEAMID\RANDOMID` for co-op saves.
For server saves, go to the dedicated server's file location through steam.
You need at least 4 files to complete the transfer:
```
- The source player character save in Players folder
- The source world's Level.sav
- The target player character save in Players folder
- The target world's Level.sav
```

## How to use Transfer Character:

‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è: Make sure to disable the private locks on the "source" chests before transferring saves!!!

Let's say we want to transfer the character from a coop world of a friend to our own world.
The friend's world would be the source, our own world the destination.

SaveGames folder of our friend:
```
SaveGames
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <steam-id>
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <source-world-id>
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Level.sav  ----------  <- The source world save
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LevelMeta.sav
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Players
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00000...0001.sav
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 12345...6789.sav   <- The source player save
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WorldOption.sav
```
Our SaveGames folder:
```
SaveGames
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <steam-id>
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <destination-world-id>
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Level.sav  ----------  <- The target world save
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LevelMeta.sav
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Players
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00000...0001.sav   <- The target player save
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 98765...4321.sav
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WorldOption.sav
```
