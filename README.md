## Steps

### 1. **Extract the Save Files:**
   - Download and unzip the **XGP-save-extractor**.
   - Run the program, follow the prompts in the command prompt, and it will output a ZIP file containing your Xbox Game Pass Palworld save files.

### 2. **Locate the Save File:**
   - Unzip the exported file.
   - Open the folder, navigate to the nested folder named **`Level`**, and find the file named **`01.sav`**.

### 3. **Rename the Save File:**
   - Rename **`01.sav`** to **`Level.sav`**.

### 4. **Prepare the Save Tools:**
   - Unzip the **PalWorldSaveTools** folder.

### 5. **Move the Save File:**
   - Move the renamed **`Level.sav`** file into the **PalWorldSaveTools** folder.

### 6. **Convert Save to JSON:**
   - Drag **`Level.sav`** onto the **`convert-sav-to-json.cmd`** file.
   - A new file named **`Level.sav.json`** will be created in the same folder.

### 7. **Delete the Original Save:**
   - Delete the **`Level.sav`** file you moved in earlier.

### 8. **Convert JSON Back to Save:**
   - Drag **`Level.sav.json`** onto the **`convert-json-to-sav.cmd`** file.
   - You should now have a newly converted **`Level.sav`** file ready to use.

## How to Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity:
1. Copy everything from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) into the same location within the tool (`PalworldSaveTools\`).
2. Run `fix_save.cmd`.
3. Run `sort_players.cmd` and/or `delete_pals_save.cmd`.
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the tool.
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.
7. Start the server up.
8. Reboot twice, once to clear the player out of Level.sav. Twice to clear the player out of ram. 
9. Profit?

## Additional Notes:
- **Days:** Tracks players inactive for a specified number of days (e.g., 30 days and older).
- **Level:** Tracks players up to a specified level (e.g., level 30 or lower).
- **Pals:** Deletes players based on the number of pals (e.g., 10 or fewer pals).
