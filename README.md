## Transferring Local Saves to Server
- Make sure to disable private locks on the "host" chests.
- If you are trying to use GamePass saves(Xbox Platform), make sure to use XPG save extractor then convert it to json. Then reconvert json back to Level.sav. Then use the tool.

## How to Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity
1. Copy everything from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) into the same location within the tool (`PalworldSaveTools\`).
2. Run `fix_save.cmd`.
3. Run `sort_players.cmd` and/or `delete_pals_save.cmd`.
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the tool.
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.
7. Start the server up.
8. Reboot twice, once to clear the player out of Level.sav. Twice to clear the player out of ram. 
9. Profit?

## Additional Notes
