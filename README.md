## Gamepass Saves

If you're playing Palworld through Xbox Game Pass, you must extract and convert your save files using the **XGP-save-extractor** and **PalWorldSaveTools**. Follow these steps:

### [XGP-save-extractor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor)

### Steps

1. **Extract the Save Files**  
   - Download and unzip the **XGP-save-extractor**.  
   - Run the program, follow the prompts in the command prompt, and it will output a ZIP file containing your Xbox Game Pass Palworld save files.

2. **Locate the Save File**  
   - Unzip the exported file.  
   - Navigate to the nested folder named `Level` and locate the file named `01.sav`.

3. **Rename the Save File**  
   - Rename `01.sav` to `Level.sav`.

4. **Prepare the Save Tools**  
   - Unzip the **PalWorldSaveTools** folder.

5. **Move the Save File**  
   - Move the renamed `Level.sav` file into the **PalWorldSave** folder.

6. **Convert Save to JSON**  
   - Select Convert Level.sav file to Level.json.
   - A new file named `Level.sav.json` will be created in the same folder.

7. **Delete the Original Save**  
   - Delete the `Level.sav` file you moved earlier.

8. **Convert JSON Back to Save**  
   - Select Convert Level.json file back to Level.sav.  
   - You should now have a newly converted `Level.sav` file ready to use.

## Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity

Follow these steps to delete inactive players based on your criteria (e.g., inactivity, level, or number of pals):

1. Copy all files from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) to the same location within the tool (`PalWorldSave`).  
2. Select Delete Inactive Players Saves.
3. Input your desired requirements, then let it finish.  
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the `PalWorldSave` folder.  
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).  
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.  
7. Restart the server:  
   - Reboot once to clear the player from `Level.sav`.  
   - Reboot a second time to clear the player from RAM.  
8. Profit?

## Steps to Restore Your Map(Fog and icons)

### 1. Find the Old Server/World ID
- **Join your old server/world**.
- Open File Explorer and run the search for:  
  `%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\`
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **old server/world ID** (e.g., `FCC47F5F4DD6AC48D3C0E2B30059973D`). The folder with the most recent modification date is typically the one for your **old server/world**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **copy** the `LocalData.sav` file from it.

### 2. Find the New Server/World ID
- **Join your new server/world**.
- Go back to the same folder path:  
  `%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\`
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **new server/world ID**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **paste** the `LocalData.sav` file from the old server/world ID into this folder.
- If the `LocalData.sav` file already exists in the new folder, **confirm the overwrite** when prompted to replace the existing file.

### 3. Restore Your Map
- Now, go into your **new server/world**, and your map should be restored with the old world data.

Done! Your map is back in your **new server/world**!
