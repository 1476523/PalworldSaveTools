## Transferring Local Saves to Server
1. Use `fix_host_save.cmd`.
2. Copy everything from:  
   `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\RANDOMID\`
3. Paste into your server save folder.
4. Start the server, create a new character, pick up an item, and wait for a save.
5. Copy everything from the server save back into `LocalWorldSave` in the tool.
6. Run `fix_host_save.cmd`, input your actual UID and old UID (from local), and the tool will update the save for you.
7. Delete the server saves, then paste the updated files from `LocalWorldSave` into the server save folder.
8. Profit?

## How to Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity
1. Copy everything from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) into the same location within the tool (`PalworldSaveTools\`).
2. Run `fix_save.cmd`.
3. Run `sort_players.cmd` and/or `delete_pals_save.cmd`.
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the tool.
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.
7. Profit?

## Additional Notes
- **Days:** Tracks players inactive for a specified number of days (e.g., 30 days and older).
- **Level:** Tracks players up to a specified level (e.g., level 30 or lower).
- **Pals:** Deletes players based on the number of pals (e.g., 10 or fewer pals).
- The fixed save (`PalworldSaveTools\fixed\Level.sav`) is no longer functional after patch v0.3+.
- As of update v0.5.5, you can view the total number of pals caught/owned. To do so, copy the server's `Players` folder into the tool's `Players` folder.
