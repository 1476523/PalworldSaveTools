## If there's errors, please make sure the saves are actually updated after each patch hits, as structures in tool and saves are always constantly changing. 

## Important Python Installation Note
- Please make sure to use the official version of Python via [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads), NOT the WindowsApps version of Python. Otherwise, you may encounter issues due to downloading and installing packages. 
- If you encounter any issues even after using the official version of Python, please install the Visual C++ Redistributable AIO from:  
[Visual C++ Redistributable AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases).
- If the cityhash hasn't been installed for some reason, likely C++ not working/broken/etc: You might have to download [VS build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
- If that fails, you may try my pre-compiled version of cityhash package [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dbz4zikmmqawpbo56a7d0/external_libs.zip?rlkey=xf6vz30qlmxrpgpr1aw2117p8&st=4oec5601&dl=1).

## Installation Directions for AIO

## Transferring Local Saves to Server
_read the fix_host_save_readme.txt for instructions and make sure to check the fix_host_save_screenshots for clear images on how to do the instructions properly_
- Make sure to disable private locks on the "host" chests.
- If you are trying to use GamePass saves(Xbox Platform), make sure to use XPG save extractor then convert it to json. Then reconvert json back to Level.sav. Then use the tool.

## How to Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity
1. Copy everything from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) into the same location within the tool (`PalworldSaveTools\`).
2. Run `fix_save.cmd`.
3. Run `sort_players.cmd` and/or `delete_pals_save.cmd`.
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the tool.
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.
7. Start the server up.
8. Reboot twice, once to clear the player out of Level.sav. Twice to clear the player out of ram. 
9. Profit?
